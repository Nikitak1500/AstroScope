Horoscope Viewer Mobile App â€“ Developed to improve UI design skills in Android and to explore working with animations in Jetpack Compose. The app is written in Kotlin and follows the MVVM pattern using Clean Architecture principles. Hilt was used for dependency injection. The UI and animations were implemented with Jetpack Compose. For convenience, horoscope data was hardcoded, while keeping the option to integrate an external API in the future.
